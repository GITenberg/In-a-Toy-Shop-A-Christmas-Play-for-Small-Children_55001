                Song Specialties for Your Entertainments


 Teachers are discovering that no matter how much novelty there is in
 their entertainment, how well it is arranged, how thoroughly drilled,
 if they want to hold the active interest of the audience they must use
 the best of songs. The songs must be real novelties. The words must be
 interesting as well as decidedly clever. The music must be catchy and
 abounding in rich melody. With these things in mind we have prepared
 this list of superior song novelties for our patrons. All are in
 regular sheet music form.

                  _Price, 35 cents each; 5 for $1.25_

                             In a Toy Shop

 counter. No toys are in sight as place is closed for the night. When
 curtain rises the proprietor has on hat and coat ready to leave.


                                  TIME

                             In a Toy Shop


 PROPRIETOR: I’m glad it’s closing time for I’m tired. I always work so
   hard the week before Christmas and I had a lot of new toys to put
   away today. I hope I have no trouble in selling them but times are
   hard. [_Shakes head._] Times are hard and Christmas isn’t what it
   used to be.

 [_He goes out, locking door. A light is left burning for the night. A
 voice calls from back of counter which should be high to make toys seem
 small._]

 VOICE: Has he really gone?

 SECOND VOICE, _from large box in corner_. [_It is the TEDDY BEAR._]
   Yes, I heard the door slam.

 FIRST VOICE: Come on out, friends, he’s gone.

 _From behind counter come TIN SOLDIERS, marching in single file to tune
   of John Brown’s Body. They sing._

 FIRST TIN SOLDIER:

    We’re brave toy soldiers dressed in uniforms so bright and new.
    We’ve been packed in horrid boxes till we’re feeling very blue.
    You’ll find us sturdy fighters and we’re brave defenders too,
                Toy soldiers brave and bold.

 _Chorus_:

                      See the brave toy soldiers marching,
                      See the brave toy soldiers marching,
                      See the brave toy soldiers marching,
                        Toy soldiers brave and bold.

 SECOND TIN SOLDIER:

  We’ve never been in battle but we’re very sure we’re brave
  And in any time of danger we’ll be proud our land to save,
  And you’ll always find us marching where our bonny flag shall wave,
              Toy soldiers brave and bold.

 THIRD TIN SOLDIER:

      We’re every one commanders—I give orders just to _me_
      And all the others drill themselves as fine as fine can be.
      We’re a most delightful army as you all can plainly see,
                  Toy soldiers brave and bold.

 If possible a simple military drill should be performed. They march to
 one side. From behind counter come books. They go to front of stage.
 As each one finishes saying her verse she steps to rear of stage
 across from SOLDIERS.

 FIRST BOOK: I’m Grimm’s Fairy Tales—every one likes me.

 SECOND BOOK: I’m Peter Rabbit, as cunning as can be.

 THIRD BOOK: I’m Anderson’s Fairy Tales, charming and sweet.

 FOURTH BOOK: I’m Black Beauty, a horse so fleet.

 FIFTH BOOK: I’m Alice in Wonderland—funny and queer.

 SIXTH BOOK: I’m the Bluebird—happy and dear.

 SEVENTH BOOK: I’m Robinson Crusoe—adventures so wild.

 EIGHTH BOOK: I’m Mother Goose, loved by every child.

 NINTH BOOK: I’m Hiawatha, the Indian boy.

 TENTH BOOK: I’m Peter Pan, the spirit of joy.

 ALL:

                  We’re nice gifts for Christmas,
                    As nice as can be,
                  And a child will be lucky
                    If Santa brings me. [_Pointing to self._]

                [BLOCKS _come from behind the counter._]

 ALL BLOCKS: We spell words.

 [THREE BLOCKS, _C, A, T, step out from rest and say_]: C—A—T— spells
   cat.

           [_In same way other blocks spell_ DOG _and_ HEN.]

 C BLOCK:

     C’s a charming letter and stands for lots of things,
     For candy, curls, and cream cakes, for crows with shiny wings.

 A BLOCK:

         A’s an awful letter, it stands for aches and ails,
         For anger, anxious, artful, and apes with curly tails.

 T BLOCK:

       T’s a tiresome letter, it stands for teach and time
       For test and think and thunder, for tickets, each a dime.

 D BLOCK:

          D’s a dainty letter, it stands for dear and dove,
          For delicate, delicious, for dollies that you love.

 O BLOCK:

            O’s an oval letter, it stands for oak and oar,
            For oatmeal and for oven, for owl and open door.

 G BLOCK:

     G’s a gaudy letter, it stands for gilt and gold,
     For gorgeous, grand and gleeful, for gladness, too, I’m told.

 H BLOCK:

      H is a happy letter, it stands for Ho, Ho, Ho,
      For hop and hope and helping, for health and home you know.

 E BLOCK:

          E is an eccentric letter, it stands for ear and eye,
          For enter and for exit, and it is the end of pie.

 N BLOCK:

     N is a needed letter, it stands for nosegay bright,
     It stands for nice and naughty, for nonsense, noon and night.

 ALL BLOCKS:

          We can spell Christmas and Santa Claus; we can spell
          anything, but we’re tired now, we’ll have to rest.

         [BLOCKS _go to rear of stage, in front of soldiers._]

       [TOPS _run out,—as they reach center of stage they sing._]

                          _Air_: RIG-A-JIG-JIG

                     1—We gayly spin with merry din
                         Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho.
                       When’er we come you’ll hear us hum.
                         Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho.

 _Chorus_:

                     Spinning around hear us gayly hum,
                       We gayly hum, we gayly hum.
                     Spinning around hear us gayly hum,
                       We gayly, gayly hum.
                     We spin and hum, we spin and hum.
                     We spin and hum, we spin and hum.
                     Spinning around hear us gayly hum,
                       We spin and gayly hum.

                   2—With dizzy head and dress of red
                       Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho,
                     We turn and twirl and twist and whirl,
                       Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho—ho.

 [_They spin round and round making a humming sound until exhausted.
 They fall back opposite blocks, in front of books. JUMPING JACKS come
 out walking jerkily._]

 ALL JUMPING JACKS:

                  We are the jolly JUMPING JACKS,
                  And pointed sticks run up our backs.
                  A trifle awkward we admit,
                  But everywhere we make a hit.
                  We’ll do some stunts to please you now.
                  Come—all together we will bow. [_They bow._]

 [_They do the following drill to music of any lively march holding each
 number four beats._]

 DRILL: 1—Heads down. 2—Heads up. 3—Right hand up. 4—Left hand up.
   5—Both hands down. 6—Right knee up. 7—Right knee down. 8—Left knee
   up. 9—Left knee down. 10—Hands on hips. 11—Bow. 12—Stand at
   attention.

 This may be continued indefinitely or modified in many ways. The
 JUMPING JACKS should stand in two rows. After first part of drill is
 finished have first row bend knees low through four beats, then rise
 and second row bend knees for four beats and repeat till tired, when
 all march to rear of stage in front of blocks. All movements as jerky
 as possible.

               [DOLLS _come to front of stage and sing._]

              _Song—Air_: MASSA’S IN THE COLD, COLD GROUND

                    1—We are beautiful French dollies—
                        See our dresses fine.
                      See our curling hair so golden,
                        See our lovely bright eyes shine.
                      We can say Papa and Mama
                        Close our eyes and cry,
                      We are most delightful dollies,
                        And of course our price is high.

 _Chorus_:

                       Lovely French dollies,
                         Most polite are we,
                       Would you like to be my owner?
                         Just step in and purchase me.

                     2—We have crossed the briny ocean
                         Just to come to you,
                       And we’re feeling almost homesick,
                         Feeling rather sad and blue.
                       If some little girl should buy us
                         We would happy be.
                       We belong in Christmas stockings,
                         Hanging from a Christmas tree.

 [_They go in front of tops, moving stiffly. Lid of box in corner raises
 slowly and a TEDDY BEAR sticks out his head._]

 TEDDY BEAR: Are you sure there aren’t any hunters here?

 SOLDIERS: Yes, it’s all right, TEDDY, come on out and stretch your
   legs. You must be stiff sitting in that box so long. [TEDDY BEAR
   _comes slowly out stretching himself and yawning._]

 TEDDY:

                        Woof, Woof. I’d like some honey.
                          Or something good and sweet.
                        I hope whoever comes for me
                          Knows what bears like to eat.
                        I’m always, always, hungry,
                          But gentle, kind and mild.
                        And it gives me lots of pleasure
                          To embrace a little child.

 ALL: But, TEDDY, you hug them too hard.

 TEDDY: No, really I don’t, that’s only gossip you’ve heard I’m always
   very gentle and I love folks very much. I’m too affectionate I’m
   afraid.

 [TEDDY _goes to back of stage and sits on floor rubbing his legs which
 are stiff from being so long in the box._]

                        _Enter STICKS OF CANDY._

 ALL _say_:

     We are very popular because we are so sweet.
     And some folks fairly eat us up. We’re always very neat.
     For we’re wrapped in tissue paper as soon as we are made
     And that’s why we are always fresh and our colors never fade.

 PEPPERMINT STICK [_red and white_]:

          I have a hot temper but yet I agree
          With most everybody as well as can be.
          I’m of peppermint flavor and fine after dinner.
          I’ll help you digest all your food and grow thinner.

 BLACK _and_ WHITE STICK, LICORICE:

                  If you have a cough try me,
                  Your cold I’ll help right instantly.
                  I’m made of licorice and will
                  Help you over many an ill.

 LEMON STICK [_yellow and white_]:

               Who likes lemon? I’m lovely and hard.
               Try me just once and I’ll win your regard.

 SPEARMINT STICK [_green and white_]:

              Spearmint’s so refreshing, just try me.
              I will make you cheerful you will all agree.

 CHOCOLATE STICK [_brown and white_]:

          Everyone eats chocolate, girls and boys as well,
          If the rest stay in the jar, I am sure _I’ll_ sell.

 ALL STICKS:

                We all are very filling
                For Christmas stockings and are willing
                To bet we’ll be the first to sell.

 ALL OTHERS: Don’t be so conceited. Your praise let others tell.

            [_Sticks go to back of stage. DOMINOES enter._]

 DOMINOES: We represent the pack. The rest are too tired to come out but
   we have more spots than they, so are stronger. We think there should
   be a game of DOMINOES in every stocking this Christmas.

 ALL OTHERS: So do we, SPOTS, so do we.

            [DOMINOES _sit on floor. Clock strikes twelve._]

 A SOLDIER: Twelve o’clock. We’d better go back to our shelves and
   boxes.

 A DOLL: Yes, we need lots of sleep so we’ll look nice tomorrow. I’d
   hate not to be sold.

 ALL TOYS: I’m sure _I’ll_ be sold, anyway.

 TEDDY BEAR: Let’s sing a song and then get back where we belong.

 ALL _sing_—

                          _Air_: HOME, SWEET HOME

       1—When sunlight is beaming we’re still as can be
         But when night hovers o’er us in dark mystery
         We come from our boxes, down from our shelves we climb,
         And while the world is sleeping we have a jolly time.

 _Chorus_:

                  Here, while the world’s asleep
                  A jolly watch we’ll keep.
                  Oh, we watch while others sleep.

          2—When the toy shop is silent and dark shadows fall
            Then out from the counter we stealthily crawl
            Our boxes are tiresome as tiresome can be,
            We yearn for the darkness that brings liberty.

 To soft music of Home, Sweet Home they disappear behind counter, dolls,
 first and soldiers last. TEDDY BEAR climbs in his box and pulls down
 lid.

 ALL: Good night. Good night.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
